# OrdnungsHub Development Summary

## What I've Created for You

1. **AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide for implementing AI features
2. **TESTING_STRATEGY.md** - Comprehensive testing approach
3. **PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md** - Optimization strategies for frontend and backend
4. **DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** - 14-week development plan with milestones
5. **QUICK_START.md** - Immediate implementation steps
6. **MASTER_CHECKLIST.md** - Prioritized task list
7. **Sample Implementation** - Working file upload component with backend endpoint

## Immediate Next Steps (Do Today)

### 1. Fix React Integration
```bash
# Update webpack config to properly handle React
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
# Then update your webpack.config.js with the React preset
```

### 2. Create Component Structure
```bash
# Run this to create the basic structure
mkdir -p src/frontend/components/{common,workspace,files,dashboard}
mkdir -p src/frontend/hooks
mkdir -p src/frontend/contexts
mkdir -p src/frontend/services
```

### 3. Test the File Upload Component
- Copy the FileUpload.jsx component I created
- Install required dependency: `npm install react-dropzone`
- Create corresponding CSS for styling
- Test with the backend endpoint

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management**: Start with Context API, migrate to Redux if needed
2. **Styling**: Use CSS Modules or styled-components for component styling
3. **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend
4. **AI Models**: Use ONNX Runtime for client-side inference
5. **Database**: SQLite for local storage with SQLAlchemy ORM

## Resources Created
- Total documentation: 7 new guides
- Sample code: File upload implementation
- Clear roadmap: 14-week plan to v1.0

## Support & Questions
The project is well-structured with a solid foundation. The main gaps are:
1. React components need to be properly integrated
2. Database models need completion
3. AI service layer needs implementation

Start with the QUICK_START.md guide and work through the MASTER_CHECKLIST.md priorities.

Good luck with your development! ðŸš€
