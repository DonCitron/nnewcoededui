# File Scanner Optimizations

## Overview

The file scanner has been significantly optimized with the following key improvements:

## üöÄ Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Chunked Processing for Large Directories
- **Feature**: Files are discovered and processed in configurable chunks
- **Benefits**: 
  - Better memory management for large directories
  - More responsive UI with incremental progress updates
  - Prevents memory exhaustion when scanning directories with thousands of files
- **Configuration**: 
  - `discovery_chunk_size`: 1000 files per discovery chunk
  - `batch_size`: 50 files per processing batch
  - `max_files_per_scan`: 10,000 file limit per scan operation

### 2. Real-time Progress Updates and Cancellation
- **Features**:
  - Detailed progress tracking with `ScanProgress` dataclass
  - Real-time performance metrics (files/second, ETA)
  - Cancellation token support for user-initiated stops
  - Progress callbacks for UI integration
- **Benefits**:
  - Users can monitor scan progress in real-time
  - Ability to cancel long-running operations
  - Better user experience with progress indicators

### 3. Improved Async Handling
- **Features**:
  - Optimized async generators for file discovery
  - Semaphore-controlled concurrent processing
  - Proper cancellation propagation throughout the pipeline
  - Timeout protection for AI processing and file operations
- **Benefits**:
  - Non-blocking operations
  - Better resource utilization
  - Graceful handling of timeouts and errors

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Features**:
  - Permission error tracking
  - Safe file metadata extraction with fallbacks
  - Basic categorization fallback when AI service fails
  - Detailed error statistics and logging
- **Benefits**:
  - More robust operation in varied environments
  - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
  - Better debugging and monitoring capabilities

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Features**:
  - File size limits to skip very large files (100MB threshold)
  - Smart file filtering to ignore system and temporary files
  - Optimized database session management
  - Concurrent processing with controlled worker limits
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster scan completion
  - Reduced resource consumption
  - Better system responsiveness

## üìä Performance Metrics

The optimized scanner now provides detailed performance tracking:

- **Discovery Time**: Time spent finding files
- **Processing Time**: Time spent categorizing and storing files
- **Files per Second**: Real-time processing rate
- **Estimated Time Remaining**: Dynamic ETA calculation
- **Memory Usage**: Chunked processing reduces peak memory usage

## üîß New API Features

### Enhanced Scan Method
```python
async def scan_directory(
    directory_path: str, 
    user_id: int,
    recursive: bool = True,
    progress_callback: Optional[Callable[[ScanProgress, Dict[str, Any]], None]] = None,
    cancellation_token: Optional[CancellationToken] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Cancellation Support
```python
# Create cancellation token
token = scanner.create_cancellation_token()

# Cancel operation
token.cancel()

# Check if cancelled
if token.is_cancelled():
    # Handle cancellation
```

### Progress Tracking
```python
def progress_callback(progress: ScanProgress, stats: Dict[str, Any]):
    print(f"Progress: {progress.progress_percent:.1f}%")
    print(f"Files/sec: {progress.files_per_second:.1f}")
    print(f"ETA: {progress.estimated_time_remaining:.1f}s")
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Improvements

1. **File Size Limits**: Automatically skip files larger than 100MB
2. **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout for AI processing, 10-second for metadata extraction
3. **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of permission denied errors
4. **Cancellation Safety**: Proper cleanup when operations are cancelled
5. **Database Safety**: Improved session management and error handling

## üìà Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization:
- Linear file processing
- No progress updates during operation
- No cancellation support
- Memory usage scales with directory size
- Limited error recovery

### After Optimization:
- Chunked processing with configurable batch sizes
- Real-time progress updates and performance metrics
- Full cancellation support with cleanup
- Bounded memory usage regardless of directory size
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Scan with Progress
```python
async def my_progress_callback(progress, stats):
    print(f"Scanning: {progress.progress_percent:.1f}% complete")

result = await scanner.scan_directory(
    "/path/to/directory",
    user_id=1,
    progress_callback=my_progress_callback
)
```

### Cancellable Scan
```python
token = scanner.create_cancellation_token()

# Start scan
scan_task = asyncio.create_task(
    scanner.scan_directory("/path", user_id=1, cancellation_token=token)
)

# Cancel if needed
token.cancel()
```

### Monitor Scan Status
```python
status = scanner.get_scan_status()
print(f"Scanning: {status['scanning']}")
print(f"Progress: {status['progress']['progress_percent']:.1f}%")
print(f"Can cancel: {status['can_cancel']}")
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

These optimizations provide a solid foundation for future improvements:

1. **Incremental Scanning**: Only scan changed files since last run
2. **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple workers/machines
3. **Smart Prioritization**: Process important files first
4. **Caching**: Cache AI results to speed up re-scans
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based progress streaming

The optimized file scanner now provides enterprise-grade performance and reliability while maintaining ease of use and integration with the existing codebase.
