## Next Steps:
1. 🧪 **Integration Testing** - Test all components together
2. 🚀 **Production Build** - Create optimized build for all worktrees  
3. 📦 **Package & Deploy** - Electron app packaging
4. 🔍 **Performance Validation** - Verify optimizations work in production

## Coordination:
**Claude Chat:** Strategic oversight + Testing coordination
**Claude Code:** Implementation complete, ready for testing phase
